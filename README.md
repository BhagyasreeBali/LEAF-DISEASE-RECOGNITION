# LEAFDISEASERECOGNITION 
Agriculture is a field that is becoming more and more important because food needs are closely connected to every sector. The increasing necessity for effective crop management to satisfy people's daily food needs is what is driving this expanding significance. As a result, early plant disease identification and management have become critical when taking biodiversity, agricultural losses, and environmental sustainability into account. The method for automated-leaf disease detection presented in this paper uses Vision Transformers (ViT) in combination with ResNet-50. Bottleneck layers are used to extract the model's features, and the Flask Python framework is then used to incorporate them into a web interface. High-resolution photos are used in the project's first phase, and the model applies preprocessing for segmentation, normalization, and noise reduction . The ViT model receives the input image first, followed by the ResNet-50 model. To find significant features from the leaf, the information retrieved by these two models are combined using a bottleneck layer . By integrating the model with the web, this project not only identify diseases but also offer suitable remedies for each one. Real-time processing, cost-effectiveness, and accurate solutions are just a few benefits of this suggested automated leaf disease detection system. It also lowers crop deficit and boosts agricultural production.
